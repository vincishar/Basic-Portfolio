<p>
I graduated from the University at Buffalo with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology 
with a minor in International Business.<br> Since then I have worked one seasonal job to 
another, until I found a stable customer service job  at Times Square.<br>I learned about coding
through a workforce event and took an online course on udemy about the basics of front-end web developlment.<br>
I've grown a high interest in coding and decided to pursue a coding bootcamp, 
the one I'm enrolled in is Columbia Universuty coding bootcamp which was something I came across through an online search.
